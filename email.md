Fellow community member,

I represent Finsig and am reaching out about our mutual interest in Polkadot. We are currently in disagreement about the Finsig SDK value proposition and I would like to better understand your position. The core value proposition I am attempting to communicate is the following:

> In order to access the addressable market locked into the Apple platform, Polkadot needs increased interest from developers currently outside our ecosystem. While this will not be easy to accomplish, it is a worthwhile endeavor that will benefit Polkadot both short and long term. More concretely, it will expand the number of app use cases possible for Polkadot.

I would like to ask your consideration in completing the anonymous survey linked below. I believe this will help us understand where I may be miscommunicating or am incorrect.
