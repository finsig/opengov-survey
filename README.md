# OpenGov Survey

**Context**  
Domain-specific knowledge can be difficult to communicate such that everyone can make a well informed decision.

**Problem**  
The point of contention between a proposal and the community is difficult to identify.

**Solution**  
Use an anonymous survey to uncover blindspots in proponent thinking and allow the proponent to better focus efforts.

**Implementation**  
iPad app written in Swift. [finsig/opengov-survey-mailer](https://github.com/finsig/opengov-survey-mailer)
